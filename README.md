# englang

It is not england :)

## This is a programming language !

#### Alright, there are so many langs, why one more you may ask :

##### Here's the story :

- When I was learning python, my first programming language, I had trouble learning the syntax, indentation and to just make what I wanted, learning all this was just too much.

- Thats why I wanted to make a language to help people who are new to programming in order to understand datatypes, structs etc. but without having to bother learning the syntax, indentation.
